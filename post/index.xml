      <description>Last friday I was invited by Mad4Hacking to a Meetup cycle about virtualization.
In my session, I have the opportunity to talk about OpenStack and related technologies, like Ceph. If you want to take a look into you can find the slides here.
See you in the next meetup!</description>

      <description>Improving your VM performance in OpenStack: NUMA and CPU Pinning Memory has a large impact in the performance of your workload. This affirmation is specially true if your workload is running on a VM, so you must be careful with your memory and NUMA if your machine supports it.
But wait! What is NUMA? In the past, processors had been designed as Symmetric Multi-processing or Uniform Memory Architecture machines, which means that all processors shared the same access to all memory available in the system.</description>
